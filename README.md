## Summary

The focus of this project was getting familiar writing TDD code. Writing test with jest was easy enough to pick up! I can't wait to get more familiar writing test first so I don't rely on console.logs as much in the future! The game of Battleship lets you place 2x submarines, 2x Destroyers, 1x Cruiser, 1x Battleship, 1x Aircraft Carrier on your board.
Room for improvements: Allow user & computer player to place ship vertically. Add more styles.
